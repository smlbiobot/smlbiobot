For the past 25+ years, I have been working in the interaction of art and technology, aligning with my childhood dream of becoming a Renaissance Man — an individual who skillfully wields both disciplines. Back then, the path wasn’t clear, but as I’ve matured, it appears I’ve been on it all along.

After graduating from Yale University in 1999, I moved to New York and started working as Designer (1999-2000) for IconNicholson / LBi International. My unique skill set allowed me to become the first employee to bridge competencies in the company’s global history,  and was promoted as Senior Designer and Senior Interface Engineer (2000-2002), and as Art Director and Senior Interface Engineer (2002-2008). With the desire to gain experience working for startups in preparation to open my own business, I joined Massify as Design Director (2008) and afterwards as Chief Creative Officer (2009-2010) for Artsy. In 2012, I moved to Hong Kong and established his my consultancy firm.

A trip to Scotland in 2017 led me to download a game called Clash Royale, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Driven by my passion for the game and the community, I created a strategy site to find the best strategy and decks via data analytics. With no official API available at the time, I initiated a partnership with a contact I made on Discord, and we rolled out a public API. That was the genesis of RoyaleAPI. We opted to make the API accessible for public use. Once Supercell released an official API, we concluded the API element of our business was no longer sustainable. We discontinued that aspect of our site but retained the name due to its existing brand equity.

RoyaleAPI started out as a personal project that’s only used by myself and a few small circle of friends. Little did I know, it would evolve into my full-time commitment with millions of monthly active users, catapulting me to the status of one of the premier content partners with Supercell, the Finish developer of the game.
