For the past 25+ years, I have been working in the interaction of art and technology. My childhood aspiration is to be a Renaissance Man, someone who applies both disciplines when they work. I didn’t know how I would do it then, but as I grow older now, it would seem that I have been working towards this all along.

After graduating from Yale University in 1999, I moved to New York and started working as Designer (1999-2000) for IconNicholson / LBi International. I became the first cross-competency employee in the company’s history worldwide, and was promoted as Senior Designer and Senior Interface Engineer (2000-2002), and as Art Director and Senior Interface Engineer (2002-2008). With the desire to gain experience working for startups in preparation to open his own business, I joined Massify as Design Director (2008) and afterwards as Chief Creative Officer (2009-2010) for Artsy. In 2012, I moved to Hong Kong and established his my consultancy firm.

In 2017, I downlaoded a game called Clash Royale during a trip to Scotland. I really enjoyed the game, and so I decided to make a strategy site to help me find the best decks for the game through data analytics. Since there wasn’t an official API available then, I partnered with someone I met on Discord and we published a public API — that’s how RoyaleAPI was born. We decided to make this API avilable to everyone to use. Eventually, Supercell published an official API, and we’ve decided the API part of the business is no longer viable, so we shutdown that part of the site, but kept our name because of brand equity.

RoyaleAPI started out as a personal project that’s only used by myself and a few friends. I never imagined that it would eventually become my full time job, and through which I would become one of the top tier content partners with Supercell, the finnish developer of the game.
