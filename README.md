See-ming Lee 李思明 (SML) is a designer and technologist with 25+ years of professional experience creating user experience (UX) and interactive media for Fortune 500 companies and startups. He is also the Founder of RoyaleAPI, a website that provides real-time analytics on battle data for the Supercell mobile game Clash Royale. 

As the Executive Director of SML Universe, a Hong Kong-based company specializing in interactive media, See-ming leverages his diverse skill set as a cross-disciplinary synergist to assist international Fortune 500 companies with their websites, advertising campaigns, interactive installations, and prototypes.

Motivated by the belief that important ideas often lack the necessary coverage, he pursued a path as a photographer and photojournalist. He documents meaningful events and individuals, aiming to give a voice to those who are marginalized due to bigotry and prejudice. Some of his photos can be found on Getty Images

After graduating from Yale University in 1999, See-ming moved to New York and started working as Designer (1999-2000) for IconNicholson / LBi International. He became the first cross-competency employee in the company’s history worldwide, and was promoted as Senior Designer and Senior Interface Engineer (2000-2002), and as Art Director and Senior Interface Engineer (2002-2008). With the desire to gain experience working for startups in preparation to open his own business, See-ming joined Massify as Design Director (2008) and afterwards as Chief Creative Officer (2009-2010) for Artsy. In 2012, he moved to Hong Kong and established his own consultancy firm.

See-ming’s projects have been featured in The Associated Press, BBC, Business Week, CBC, CNet, CNN, Forbes, International Herald Tribune, New York Times, Red Herring, ReadWriteWeb, Reuters, USA Today, Vanity Fair, Washington Post and Yahoo! 

His projects have also been recognized in multiple international design and technology awards including the prestigious Omni Intermedia Awards, One Show Interactive awards, WWW Health Awards, WMA Web Awards and Graphis Interactive Annuals.

## About RoyaleAPI

RoyaleAPI is a website that provides analytics, profiles and insights for Clash Royale, a popular online card game. RoyaleAPI helps players to:

- Find the best cards and decks to use in the game.
- Track their progress, rewards, and rankings in the game.
- Learn from other players and improve their skills and strategies.

RoyaleAPI was founded by See-ming Lee (SML) in 2017, originally as an API service for developers, and later as a website for players. The API service was discontinued in 2020 due to high costs, and RoyaleAPI now exists purely as an end-user product. The name of the company was kept due to existing brand equity. 

RoyaleAPI is a registered trademark in the US, and is wholly owned and operated by SML Universe.
